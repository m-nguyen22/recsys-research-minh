# Experimental Recommender System Project - Northeastern Illinois Univserity
In collaboration with @ian-mcnair, @rainercarr, Dr. Xiwei Wang and Marcelo Sztainberg, and others. Our work is supported by the NEIU Student Center For Scientific Engagement.

## About

This repository contains code snippets taken over the course of the project, which is still currently ongoing. These code snippets are taken out of context and may lack the necessary files to be ran. The included files are just some of my contributions to the project meant for display.

This research project aims to create a privacy preserving recommender system that uses Weighted Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Location-Based Social Networks, specifically Point-of-Interest recommendation. 

./Notebooks/ include some of the python notebooks created for the project. As of November 2019, these have been our primary local environment for experiments and developing the project. 
./Research/ include modules built at the start of the project for research into recommender systems. Files include modules for user-user/item-item similarity and WNMF built for the Yelp dataset.
